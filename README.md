This repository contains some of the research papers I have worked on.
The Generative AI Possibility paper is a whitepaper written collaboratively to discuss Generative AI applications across different field. 
My contribution can be found in chapter 5 (page 33) titled **Filling the Protein Gap with Generative AI** in 2023. It will interest you if you are interested in Generative AI for Biology

The Geosemantic Entity Recognition paper was accepted and presented at the Data Science Africa conference (Kenya) and the Deep Learning Indaba conference.
The paper Title is **Geosemantic Entity Recognition and Mapping of Electoral Violence Hotspots from News Reports**
It is focused on using Geo-NLP to solve Electoral violence with the case study being the 2023 Nigerian Election

The Enhancing Inclusivity Paper was an ongoing research showcased as a poster at the Deep Learning Indaba Conference 2024 (Senegal) and Neurips 2025 (Canada) at the Women In Machine Learning (WiML) Workshop
It is a Machine Translation project and was just at the early stage of comparison with other state-of-the-art LLM models for Pidgin-English

The completion of the Machine Translation project birthed **How Effective Are AI Models in Translating English Scientific Texts to Nigerian Pidgin A Low-Resource Language** which was showcased at the ICBINB workshop at ICLR Conference 2025, Singapore, where it won the Didactic paper award on the paper that does a good job at explaning the issues.
